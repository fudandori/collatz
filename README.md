Simple web to play with the Collatz Conjecture.

## How to play

You just pick a number, type it in at the top left text box and click the button. 

You will see the chain numbers generated by the Collatz Algorithm flying in and out and in the middle of the screen the counter for how many steps (also called time) it takes to reach 1.

At the top right you can see the biggest chain you generated for the session.

Have fun!
